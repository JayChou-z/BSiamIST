# BSiamIST
Specifically, a butterfly-shaped model is constructed to extract the deep feature of an infrared dim and small target. In addition, an interactive head is incorporated into the anchor-free Siamese framework to gain more accurate precise network parameters, helping to improve the stability of the algorithm.
